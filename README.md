# KoGaMaLib

KoGaMaLib is a personal archive containing a wide range of experimental, historical, and miscellaneous resources related to the KoGaMa website and game. The contents span different periods, purposes, and levels of polish, and reflect exploratory work rather than a single cohesive project.

This repository includes items such as:
- legacy or abandoned experiments
- prototype scripts and tooling
- cosmetic or theme related assets
- small utilities and fragments created for learning or testing purposes

Some materials originate from private development contexts and are preserved here purely for reference and archival reasons.
